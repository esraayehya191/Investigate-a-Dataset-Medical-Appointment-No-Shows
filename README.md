# Investigate-a-Dataset-Medical-Appointment-No-Shows

## Project Overview

In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib` to make my analysis easier.

## Introduction

For the project, I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. I should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I should use `Pandas` and `NumPy` to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.

**Selected dataset**: [No-show appointments](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd2e9a_noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016/noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv&sa=D&ust=1510020454356000&usg=AFQjCNEEOPkttwxzEyo0gjL5cfxq6ynIgg)

**Dataset Description**:
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
- ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
- ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
- Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

**Steps**:
